## Overview
Mastodon is a free, open-source social network. A decentralized alternative to commercial platforms, it avoids the risks of a single company monopolizing your communication. Pick a server that you trust â€” whichever you choose, you can interact with everyone else. Anyone can run their own Mastodon instance and participate in the social network seamlessly.

**Shipped version:** 2.7.4

## Configuration

### Adding "swapfile" If you have less than 2Go of RAM
```
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1024000
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
```
add this line on /etc/fstab
```
/swapfile       none    swap    sw      0       0
```

### Adding cron to free space

Here's a quick tip to free a lot of space on your instance.
Indeed the media (images and videos, attachments) of other instances are cached on your server and are never deleted.
This consumes a lot of space and Mastodon being instantaneous, there is little chance that old media will serve. Thus, we can set up a daily cron that will remove cache external media, more than X days old.

We edit the crontab :
```
crontab -e -u mastodon
```
We add:
```
@daily cd /var/www/mastodon/live && RAILS_ENV=production NUM_DAYS=30 /var/www/mastodon/.rbenv/shims/bundle exec rails
mastodon:media:remove_remote
```

### Install
#### Using __screen__ in case of disconnect
```
$ sudo apt-get install screen
$ screen
$ sudo yunohost app install https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mastodon_ynh.git
```
Recover after disconnect:
```
$ screen -d
$ screen -r
```
The admin user is automatically created as: user@domain.tld

### Update
#### Using __screen__ highly recommended

`$ sudo yunohost app upgrade --verbose mastodon -u https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mastodon_ynh.git`

## Recommendation

You can't install Mastodon in subdirectory, you must use a domain or subdomain for this application.

It seems important to close the inscriptions for your Mastodon, so that it remains a private body. We invite you to block remote malicious instances from the administration interface. You can also add text on your home page.
